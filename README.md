# AI-Selfhealing Pipeline

Experimental repo exploring how LLMs like ChatGPT could observe and assist with CI/CD troubleshooting in real time.

## Concept

- Watch CI/CD pipeline logs
- Summarize issues using an LLM
- Trigger suggestions or actions for resolution
- Close the loop via GitHub PR comments or alerts

## Stack

- GitLab CI/CD or Argo Workflows
- OpenAI API / GPT-4 / Claude
- GitOps feedback loop

## Status

Very early experimentation. Ideas > implementation.

## Goal

Learn how LLMs can support observability, triage, and operational clarity inside DevOps pipelines.
